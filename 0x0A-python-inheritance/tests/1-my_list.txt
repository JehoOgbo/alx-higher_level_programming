This file is a doctest file for the class ``MyList()`` which inherits from the `list` class and defines a method ``print_sorted()`` which prints a sorted version of a list without changing the order of the original
All inputs to this file are expected to be of type integers
============
``My_list()`` has all the capabilities of a list with the added benefit of the additional print_sorted() method

::

		>>> MyList = __import__("1-my_list").MyList
		>>> mylist = MyList()
		>>> mylist.append(1)
		>>> mylist.append(4)
		>>> mylist.append(2)
		>>> mylist.append(3)
		>>> mylist.append(5)
		>>> print(mylist)
		[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]
		>>> mylist.pop()
		5
		>>> print(mylist)
		[1, 4, 2, 3]

The ``print_sorted()`` method creates a sorted version of the list

::

		>>> mylist.print_sorted()
		[1, 2, 3, 4]
		>>> print(mylist)
		[1, 4, 2, 3]
