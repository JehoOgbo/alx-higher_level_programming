This is a doctest for a class ``BaseGeometry`` found in the file 7-base_geometry.py
This class contains an init method that does nothing as the class itself takes no arguments
::
		>>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
		>>> bg = BaseGeometry()

The class possesses a method area which raises an exception when called
::
		>>> bg.area()
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		Exception: area() is not implemented

There is also a public instance method which checks if a value is of type int and if its less than 0. Note that the other argument to this function is assumed will always be a string
::
		# case for data type other than int entered
		>>> bg.integer_validator("weight", 53.87)
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		TypeError: weight must be an integer

		>>> bg.integer_validator("weight", "my_name")	
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		TypeError: weight must be an integer

		>>> bg.integer_validator("weight", True)
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		TypeError: weight must be an integer

		# case for number <= 0
		>>> bg.integer_validator("height", -45)
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		ValueError: height must be greater than 0

		>>> bg.integer_validator("height", 0)
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		ValueError: height must be greater than 0

However if everything is in order, this function will not print or return anything
::
		# case for correct values entered
		>>> bg.integer_validator("length", 8)
