# 2-matrix_divided.txt

This file serves as a doctest file for ``matrix_divided()``.

Numbers only
===========

``matrix_divided(matrix, div)`` returns a new matrix containing all elements of original matrix divided by a given number div. It takes only numbers and performs divisions using the ``/`` operator. It can take negative values.
It doesn't change the original list

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> a = [[2, 4], [8, 10]]
	>>> matrix_divided(a, 2)
	[[1.0, 2.0], [4.0, 5.0]]
	>>> print(a)
	[[2, 4], [8, 10]]

It can take both a matrix of integers and floats as first arg and a float or int as the second
All elements of the new list must be rounded off to two decimal places
::

	>>> b = [[2.2, 2.4], [6.4, 8.4]]
	>>> matrix_divided(b, 2)
	[[1.1, 1.2], [3.2, 4.2]]
	>>> matrix_divided(b, 0.5)
	[[4.4, 4.8], [12.8, 16.8]]
	>>> matrix_divided(b, 3)
	[[0.73, 0.8], [2.13, 2.8]]

# All errors concerning div take precedence
If div is a data type other than an int or float, return a typeError with the message ``div must be a number``

::

	>>> matrix_divided(a, "a")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: div must be a number
	>>> matrix_divided(a, [2, 3])
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: div must be a number

If div is Zero, return a ZeroDivisionError with the message ``division by Zero``

::

	>>> matrix_divided(a, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by Zero

If all rows of the matrix are not the same size, it raises a type Error

::

	>>> c = [[2, 4], [2, 5, 6], [3, 9]]
	>>> matrix_divided(c, 9)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

If an element of an element of the matrix is not an int or float, raise a typeError

::

	>>> c = [[2, 4], [3, "sing"], [4, 5]]
	>>> matrix_divided(c, 7)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

If a data type other than an integer or a float is entered, it raises a TypeError with a message depending on which variable has received a wrong input.
The first argument takes precedence meaning if both values were of the wrong type, an Exception will be raised for the first argument only.

::

	# case for a is a string
	#>>> add_integer("i am a boy", 7)
	#Traceback (most recent call last):
	#...

	# case for b is None
	#TypeError: a must be an integer
	#>>> add_integer(7, None)
	#Traceback (most recent call last):
	#...
	#TypeError: b must be an integer

	# case for both a and b are wrong data type
	#>>> add_integer([8, 9], "this")
	#Traceback (most recent call last):
	#...
	#TypeError: a must be an integer
